Car buying is happening online - everyone knows this. However, car dealers have been slow to evolve with the changing times. In this blog series, I'll highlight what dealers can learn from the online retail giant, Amazon. While they do some clever and innovative things, they also execute really well on a few basic principles. I'll focus on those and explain why they are important.

Amazon is massive and ubiquitous. If you want to buy something online, you typically are going to buy it on Amazon. They are the king of online retail and all consumers, including car buyers, have been affected by the "Amazon buying experience". They prefer and expect a certain experience when they shop. If they don't encounter it, they can be turned off and look else. In order to thrive in online retail, you need to accept that there are consumer expectations and make sure you deliver. If not, you'll lose out to competitors that do.

## Amazon invests and rocks at SEO

Think about where the online buying experience starts: a Google search. Whether it's a digital camera, a tennis racquet, or a pepper mill, people start buying by searching on Google. And guess who shows up organically in the first 3 search results in most cases? Yep, Amazon does. By showing up in the top three, they often times are above the list of images results that Google often displays.

Amazon knows that buyers start with a Google search, therefore Amazon invests heavily in SEO to ensure that they appear front and center on as many Google searches as possible. They continue to invest despite being the de facto online retailer. Think about it: even though everyone knows about Amazon, a lot of buyers still start with a Google search. Hence, Amazon ensures they capture those buyers and funnel them to Google. Also, SEO is a big reason why Amazon is always in our heads - because they always appear when we search for stuff online. In this respect, SEO becomes a passive form of brand advertising.

Amazon also knows that there are some people are even too lazy to type in "Amazon.com" and navigate through their website, and prefer to do a product search in Google and fully expect to be taken to the correct product or category page in Amazon. A similar scenario occurs frequently on mobile devices, where users want to type and swipe the fewest times in order to reach their destination. Therefore, mobile users will simply type into their search bar the item they want to buy. Then they expect Google to take care of the rest.

It's clear that online shoppers start their buying by going to Google and they expect Google to take them to a good retailer. Despite being the clear market leader, Amazon continues to make sure they show up in the first 3 search results because they want to maintain a smooth and effortless transition to their our website. Car dealers have to embrace the online retail space because their buyers are there. To help draw customers to their website, dealers should dedicate resources to SEO. Furthermore, car dealers need to understand that SEO (traditional and local) is a necessary investment that cannot be half-assed. It requires full-time attention, but will pay huge dividends in the end. By appearing high in search page results, car dealers will capture buyers whenever they start looking for a new car, because it always starts with a Google search.
