Predictive analytics are going to be a main topic of conversation in the automotive industry in 1-2 years.  The field is growing in many industries as we speak and the term is going to be popping up in more and more news articles over the coming 24 months. In this post, I'm going to briefly introduce what predictive analytics are, then discuss how the big firms in Wall Street are turning to predictive analytics to inform their trading decisions. Finally, I'll conclude by highlighting the two key reasons why predictive analytics will be a major influence in the auto industry in the near future.

## What are predictive analytics?
In short, it's the art of using information to predict outcomes, and for decades, companies and statisticians have been finding ways to do this. In the 1973, the Black-Scholes model was presented in a paper and could be used to predict stock options prices. In the 1990s, with the advent of growing computer and internet usage, many companies began heavily investing in using computer models to help with their predictions. As computer technology continued to grow in the 2000s, we started hearing about Big Data – we were now capable of collecting and storing massive amounts of information. Companies like Google were building massive data centers throughout the world to store all this information. As of this writing, IBM and Range Technology are constructing a 6.3 million sq/ft data center in Langfang, China, which will be roughly the same size as the US Pentagon. The research group, IDC, [predicts that by 2017 there will be 8.6 million data centers in the world][idc]. That's an insane number and we're building these massive data centers because we're storing even more insane amounts of information everyday.

Given that we have massive of data on everything imaginable, it was a logical next step that a bunch of people wanted to figure out how to make sense of all of it.  Hence, predictive analytics has grown even more because this Big Data revolution. It's also evolved – you can't fit the data in an Excel spreadsheet and plot some graphs, there's way too much of it. Nowadays, complex (and often custom) computer algorithms must be employed to find insights. There is a growing demand for data scientists in all industries: a multi-talented person that's one-part statistician, one-part programmer, and one-part Artificial Intelligence expert. What's exciting is that computers are up to the task, and with proper guidance from a great data scientist, computers find relationships and patterns in information that are impossible to see with the human eye. Predictive analytics have evolved and improved immensely, thanks to the advent of Big Data.

## How Wall Street is turning to predictive analytics

Major hedge funds and trading firms are now using computer models to drive their trading strategies. Goldman Sachs announced at the beginning of 2016, [they would be investing heavily in cutting-edge predictive analytics using artificial intelligence and machine learning][sachs].  JPMorgan'a CEO posted a memo in December 2015 and said his company would be aggressively pursuing predictive analytics through the development of big data applications. The market research firm, [Preqin][preqin], recently cited [1360 hedge funds were using computer models to drive their portfolio decisions][wired]. The reason Wall Street is embracing predictive analytics is because computers are now able to adjust their predictions as they gather more information. Meaning, computers will adapt their predictions as new information is fed to them. In the past, groups of smart people would get together and analyze some data. Afterwards, they would create a predictive model. However, the model would be static, meaning it wouldn't adjust to future changes. With the computer technology improving, computers are able to analyze new data and incorporate their findings into their predictions. Since the stock market is affected by tons of factors and new factors can appear, companies are employing teams of data scientists to create predictive computer models that are able to adjust constantly to the changing and appearing of market factors. Wall Street has realized predictive analytics are not "snake oil", but it fact a reliable and well-researched field that can be trusted to aid decision-making that involves billions of dollars.

## The auto industry is PERFECT for predictive analytics

The auto industry is primed to benefit hugely from the insights that predictive analytics can provide. There are two factors why the auto is perfect for predictive analytics.

### Since 90% of car shopping happens online, there's TONS OF DATA ###

The premise is simple: if a computer model has enough data, it can make reliable predictions on outcomes. There's PLENTY of data in auto shopping, because a majority of car shopping is done online, where every visit and click is recorded. The latest studies have car buyers spending 90% of their shopping time online and visiting only 1.2 dealerships. Meaning, people are going to a specific dealership, because they have a good idea of what they want. Occasionally, they'll leave dissatisfied, and have to go to a second dealership. The challenge for auto dealers is that they're in the dark for most of the shopping time. Two-thirds of walk-ins don't contact the dealer ahead of time. That means car dealers are playing catch-up with most of their walk-ins. However, by turning to predictive analytics, dealers can see and understand what people are doing and what they think of their inventory before they walk in the dealership door. Just because people are "kicking the tires" of vehicles online doesn't mean that information is lost to dealers.

### Dealers have time to react to predictions ###

Cars are a big ticket item that typically involve a lot of research on behalf the buyer. People check out different websites to learn about the cars that interest them and what's available in their area. They visit various dealership websites to browse inventories and compare prices and features. Because auto buyers are taking weeks to narrow down their decision, auto dealers have time to data mine the online research their customers are doing and make adjustments before those same customers enter their dealership. That's a powerful notion and auto dealers can use that to adjust things like prices, promotions, lead information, and inventory. Many other items in retail require little to no research on the customer's part. Buying is more of "in-the-moment" decision. In these cases, data mining can give you overall insights but not ones you can act on to improve outcomes with current shoppers. Auto dealers have the advantage that car shoppers are doing their lengthy research online, and during that time, a dealer can be data mining and taking action preemptively to maximize profits.
