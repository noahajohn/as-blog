As I start writing this post, I'm on my return flight back from Las Vegas, where I attended the [2016 National Automotive Dealer Association (NADA) conference][nada].  It's one of the largest auto dealer conferences in the world. This year, it attracted around 20,000 attendees, including some 3,000 from outside the USA. There were more than 600 vendors presenting their products at the expo. In addition, there were educational workshops and roundtables at different times during each day. In this post, I'll report on the digital side of things and what my impressions were as a first timer to the event.

My approach was simple, I wanted to participate in as many different events as possible. I focused on vendors and workshops in the digital realm. The following are my key takeaways.

## Online retail concepts are entering car retail
Everyone is car shopping online these days and using their mobile device more frequently to do it. For online retailers, this is old news, but for car dealers, this is a relatively new development. Online retail has grown so much over the past 5 years that consumers are accustomed to going online to buy anything – and that includes cars now. Hence, they want buying a car to be same as buying something off Amazon. The Amazon website is fast on all your devices, you can do all research there, and buying is frictionless. Online retailers succeed because they have teams of software engineers to support their websites and make them user friendly. Car dealers generally don't have many techies, if at all, and are infamous for having one overworked "internet sales manager" – that poor soul that does any job that involves a computer.  Car buying hasn't changed much, but it can, and dealers at NADA are slowing learning that they need to adapt. 

## SEO, mobile, and social media continue to be hot topics
Workshops on SEO, mobile, and social media attracted large crowds. SEO and mobile optimization are hot topics because car dealers are competing for leads on a daily basis. As a result, dealers dedicate significant resources to landing the top stop in organic search results, which means they have to invest in SEO. In addition, car dealer websites need to be optimized for mobile, with presenter [Ali Amirrezvani][ali] advocating that website design should be "mobile-first" now. Forget about the desktop version, make sure your mobile site is fast and usable, then worry about a desktop version. To further his point, Ali cited that 40% of mobile website visitors will abandon a site if it doesn't load within 3 seconds. Finally, auto dealers at NADA were learning to invest more of their marketing budget into social media advertising. Social media is not exclusively being used by teenagers anymore – there are millions of car buyers on social networks now. Therefore, social media ad campaigns can have a huge reach if properly implemented.

## The digital vendors really want to educate the dealers and earn their trust
I spoke with as many digital vendors as I could find. The common thread among them all was that they had to communicate the value of their service to auto dealers. It sounds obvious, but it was a big challenge at NADA. There's a divide between dealers and vendors. Vendors generally have younger, tech-minded folks while the dealers generally are older and less tech-inclined. The dealers have been selling cars for decades and understandably balk somewhat when a younger salesman with far less car sales experience starts explaining how this mysterious technology can improve ROI. I even heard a car dealers refer to certain digital products as "snake-oil". In my estimation, most of the products I saw offered value to dealers if they were used correctly. However, in order to adopt the product, a dealer needs to understand it, trust it, AND use it. Unfortunately, many dealers lack in-house tech knowledge and struggle to hire techies. Their tech vocabulary is limited, but they're getting bombarded with tech sales pitches that all sound the same. Given this situation, I got the impression that most of the digital vendors, especially the smaller ones, were all on the same team at NADA. In the end, they were all selling by educating, because they had to explain basic digital concepts before they could focus on the specialties of their own product.

## Final thoughts
I was blown away by how forthcoming everyone – dealers and vendors alike – was with sharing information with me. As a new face at NADA, I really appreciated that treatment. Most of the vendors were honest and encouraging to a fellow entrepreneur. Similarly, most of the dealers I met were open-minded and interested in discussing the latest trends. For that, I sincerely thank everyone that I met at NADA and I hope to see you next year!
