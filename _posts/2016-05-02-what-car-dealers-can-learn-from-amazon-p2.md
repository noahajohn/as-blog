In this blog series, I highlight what auto dealers can learn from Amazon. [In part one, I focused on how important SEO is to Amazon's business]({% post_url 2016-04-25-what-car-dealers-can-learn-from-amazon-p1 %}) and why they invest significantly to ensure they appear in the top 3 of many product searches. In this part, I'm going to discuss how Amazon utilizes social media to increase their ROI.

## Amazon interacts with its customers on ALL of social media

How many social media networks does Amazon actively use? Answer: all of them. Here's a summary of the major ones, as of this writing.

* Facebook: 26,653,012 followers
* LinkedIn: 1,559,803 followers
* Twitter: 2.23M followers
* Instagram 486K followers
* Vine: 8 million loops posted
* Snapchat: been active for over 2 years
* Pinterest: 41k followers and 54 boards
* Youtube: 85K channel subscribers and 171,046,367 video views
* Also active on Periscope and Tumblr

That's a lot of networks, which means Amazon is creating a ton of content on a regular basis. While some of the content can be shared amongst some networks, they generally have to tailor content for each network because it's a slightly different medium. It's a herculean effort that never stops and requires constant attention. However, Amazon does this because the payoffs are worth it.

## Payoff #1: By growing their social media reach, Amazon is improving the odds people go to them first.

It's all about staying on people's minds. People are pulled in all different directions by various sources. We are easily distracted by cool things that we see online. Heck, [South Park did an entire episode on this phenomena][southpark]. To avoid some of the noise, Amazon uses social media to connect directly with the public. By frequently engaging them, Amazon is staying in people's minds and improving the likelihood that people turn to them first.

## Payoff #2: Cool content and informative content improve Amazon's brand awareness and image.

As we've seen above, Amazon has a ridiculous amount of followers across a multitude of social media platforms. They grew their network organically and the recipe is simple.  **Provide something valuable to your followers.** The value can come in many different forms. For example, Amazon has an awesome series of video shorts for the kitchen:

They're concise, informative, and easily sharable ‚Äì meaning the video is awesome to repost in Facebook. Creating informative content like this provides value to people and will motivate them to follow you. Here's another example from Amazon's Instagram account:

<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="6" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div> <p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BEgrmNkoUez/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank">We are gettin&#39; wild with our flavor combos this #NationalJellyBeanDay! üòú What&#39;s the weirdest combination you&#39;ve ever accidentally eaten?

<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>

It's a cool image that tells people about National Jelly Bean Day. It's a random fact, but nonetheless a fun and informative fact. That's what Amazon does well. All they content adds something to people's day. They're not trying to massively sway people with content; just give them a cool nugget of info or a funny video that will make someone a little happier for a moment. By delivering valuable content consistently, Amazon is giving people plenty of reasons to follow them. It's a simple recipe, but you need to be genuine and post regularly.

## Payoff #3: Amazon is hanging out with customers where they spend the most time ‚Äì online

I vividly remember visiting friends in Seattle a few years ago and going to an awesome brunch restaurant in town. We had reserved a table for 5 and got there a little early. When we arrived, we were told our table would be ready in 10 minutes. We all sat down in the waiting area and immediately pulled out our phones. Instead of chatting amongst ourselves, we all turned to our mobile screens and zoned out. In those 10 minutes of waiting, we could have just as well been 5 strangers. This is what many of us do now ‚Äì we zone out on our phones whenever we have a chance.  

The implication is that we continue to spend more and more time engaging with content on the internet. Which means our eyes and ears are easily reached if we're engaged through our phones. Hence, Amazon comes to us through social media because that's where we spend more time and that's where we're more likely to listen. Taking it a step further, Amazon stays up-to-date on what social media networks are being used, what the demographics are of each network's users, and cater their content to that audience.

## Bottom Line (TL;DR version)

Like or not, our society interacts more and more online. To reach people, you can engage them via social media because that's where they spend a lot of their time. To grow your followers, you need to consistently post genuine, valuable content. Amazon does this on tons of social media networks and tailors their content accordingly to the network and the network's user demographic. By doing this, Amazon is promoting brand awareness and increasing the likelihood that customers go to them first.
