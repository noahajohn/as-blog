In part 3 of my series on what Amazon does right, I’m going to discuss their mobile experience. If you haven’t already, be sure to check out [part one]({% post_url 2016-04-25-what-car-dealers-can-learn-from-amazon-p1 %}) and [part two]({% post_url 2016-05-02-what-car-dealers-can-learn-from-amazon-p2 %}) of this series. Amazon knows that mobile device usage is significant and growing. [Over 25% of all website page views occur on mobile devices in the USA.][statista] In order to accommodate this traffic, Amazon tailors its website for mobile users so the user experience on a phone is second to none. They do this to ensure their mobile visitors stay on their website and buy stuff. Mobile users expect a responsive and user-friendly experience and will quickly be turned off if they don’t encounter it. Here are three key things to learn from Amazon.

## Because Amazon has a great mobile site, Google doesn’t penalize them in mobile search results

That’s right, Google only wants to push mobile-optimized sites to its search results. Hence, they’ve defined criteria for “mobile-friendly” websites. If a website is not deemed “mobile friendly” by Google, it’s unlikely to appear when someone searches from a mobile device. Google is transparent about their intentions and [provides a clear explanation of how to make a website mobile friendly][google-mobile-info]. They also have a [great tool for analyzing your website][mobile-tester] that evaluates your website for mobile friendliness. If this information is new to you, be sure to read up on it and check out how your mobile site performs in Google’s eyes.

## It is super-fast on mobile

Mobile sites need to be fast for two practical reasons. First, people don’t have the patience to endure slow page load times. They will quickly navigate away if they don’t see a response. [In a previous blog, I stated that mobile experts cite 40% of mobile website visitors will abandon a site if it doesn’t load within 3 seconds.](% post_url 2016-04-18-first-timer-at-nada %) Second, since most mobile phone searches are frequently done using a data plan, which is slower than a standard broadband internet connection, you need to ensure your website is optimized to still load fast on these slower connections.  Amazon respects users’ time and delivers a robust, but lightweight site that looks great and loads fast.

## Everything important is, at most, one tap away

Another way people lose patience with a website is if common tasks take time or are difficult to perform. Amazon tries to follow good design practices and makes common tasks quick and easy to execute. If you’re looking for some awesome design pointers, [Google published a great resource on good mobile site design][google-mobile-design] that was the result of a sophisticated research study that they conducted. In Amazon’s case, they want to felicitate purchases. They have a single, large button for “add to cart” which leads to another page that allows people to checkout immediately. If you already have your billing details on file, you’re only left with specifying shipping type and confirming your order. The purchase path is fast and each next step is highlighted.

## Bottom Line (TL;DR version)

Amazon knows more and more people use their mobile devices to shop on Amazon. Hence, they make sure their site is optimized for mobile devices, by having quick page load times and clear page design. In doing so, Google favors Amazon in search results because their site is deemed mobile friendly. Also, users don't turn away because of lack of responsiveness. The end result is Amazon continues to capture purchases despite the buyers coming from 
smaller screens with slower internet speeds.
